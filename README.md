# KNN-Recommender-Model

This project contains 30 movies with nine features, such as rating and category association. This model uses the KNN algorithm to predict the most similar or most closely related items. It is a scaled down version that attempts to mimic a recommender system from a large streaming service such as Netflix or Hulu. 

## Steps
1. Import necessary packages
2. Examining descriptive stats of the dataset
3. Create Feature Matrix and Test Matrix
4. Build KNN Model and return 5 closest movies

## Requirements

* Python
* Google Colab

## Packages 


import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

## Launch

Download *Joshua_Rotuna_CA06.ipynb* and open the file in Google Colab.

Run the code.
